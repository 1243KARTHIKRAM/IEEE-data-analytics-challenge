# 🌍 Global Development Data Analysis

This project focuses on **cleaning** and **analyzing** a dataset featuring key global development indicators:

- **Total Population**
- **Rural Population (%)**
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**
- **Electricity Access (%)**

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The dataset required substantial preprocessing to ensure **accuracy** and **consistency**.

### Key Cleaning Steps:
- Eliminating null values and duplicate entries  
- Renaming columns for clarity and consistency  
- Converting data types (e.g., GDP to numeric format)  
- Handling missing values using interpolation and statistical methods  
- Normalizing percentage fields to enable accurate comparisons  

> ✅ A fully cleaned version of the dataset is now available for analysis.
