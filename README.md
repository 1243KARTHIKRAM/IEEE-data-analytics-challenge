🌍 Global Development Data Analysis
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset featuring key global development indicators:

Total Population

Rural Population (%)

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

Electricity Access (%)

🧹 Data Cleaning
The dataset required substantial preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key cleaning steps included:

Eliminating null values and duplicate entries

Renaming columns for clarity and consistency

Converting data types (e.g., GDP to numeric format)

Handling missing values using interpolation and statistical methods

Normalizing percentage fields to enable accurate comparisons

A fully cleaned version of the dataset is now available for use.

📊 Data Analysis
Several analyses were performed to extract meaningful insights, such as:

Examining the correlation between GDP and electricity access

Analyzing the relationship between rural population percentages and electricity supply

Performing country-wise comparisons and identifying regional patterns

Visualizing trends and relationships using plots and charts

All analysis notebooks can be found in the corresponding directory.
